There are 2 large numbers. The numbers are represented as an array.

1. The numbers have the same number of digits, e.g. [130 0 0 0 0 0 0] + [8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] = [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] 

2.calculate the difference. The numbers have the same number of digits, e.g. [83 0 0 0 0 0 0] [5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0] = [2 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3.Calculate the multiplication. The first number is a large number,the second number is only one digit.e.g.[2 3 6 0 0 0 0 0] * 2 = [4 7 2 0 0 0 0 0]

4.Calculate the integer division.The first number is a large number,the second number is only one digit.e.g.[2 3 6 0 0 0 0 0] / 2 = [1 1 8 0 0 0 0 0]
